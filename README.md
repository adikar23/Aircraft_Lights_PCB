# Aircraft_Lights_PCB

Project Background
>Aviation and technology have always fascinated me, ever since I was a child. I've always been fascinated by aircraft and airspace, as well as how organised and systematic the entire aviation industry is. Each step ensures the plane's and passengers' safety. One of the various safety measures used in aviation is the use of exterior lighting on an aircraft.

# Exterior lights on an Aircraft.
There are various lights on the exterior of an aircraft, each having its unique task. Some of the important lights are as follows:
> * **LANDING/TAKEOFF LIGHTS**- These lights are used while the aircraft is taking off or while landing. They are very high intensity lights which help the pilot of an aircraft have a better visibility of the runway or any obstacles.
> * **TAXI LIGHTS**- These lights help pilots have a better visibility at the taxiways of an airport while moving towards the apron after landing or moving towards the runway for takeoff.
> * **RUNWAY TURNOFF LIGHTS**- These lights help pilot identify the runway exit points after landing. The lights are pointing towards side of the runway which makes it easier to spot an exit.
> * **NAVIGATION LIGHTS**- These lights are helpful for other near by planes to identify the direction where the plane is moving. When mid air during high speeds, it is important to know the direction of an aircraft to near by planes. One can identify the direction based on colour which defines the positioning as follows:
>   * **LEFT NAV LIGHT**- These lights are placed on the tip of the left wing. They generally are RED coloured.
>   * **RIGHT NAV LIGHT**- These lights are placed on the tip of the right wing. They generally are GREEN coloured.
>   * **TAIL NAV LIGHT**- These lights are placed near the tail of the aircraft. They generally are WHITE coloured.
> * **STROBE LIGHTS**- These lights are used when the plane has enterned an active runway for takeoff or even while crossing the runway. This makes other planes aware about the presence of an aircraft on the runway. As these lights are flashing constantly, they are also used midair which makes it easier to get attention of surrounding planes for safety.
>   * **LEFT STROBE LIGHT**- This light is a Flashing WHITE light placed on the left wing.
>   * **RIGHT STROBE LIGHT**- This light is a Flashing WHITE light placed on the right wing.
>   * **TAIL STROBE LIGHT**- This light is a Flashing WHITE light placed on the tail of the aircraft.
> * **BEACON LIGHT**- This light is helpful for any observer on the ground to identify that the aircraft has its engine up and rolling. It makes the observer causious to not get close to the aircraft. It is a RED coloured flashing light, generally located on the top or the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage.

# About the Aircraft_Lights_PCB

The Aviation and Electronics fanatic in me had an idea to design a PCB that depicted the exteriorÂ lights of an aircraft. I decided to make an Aircraft shaped PCB to demonstrate the generalised placement of lights on an aircraft. The **USELESS DESIGN COMPETITION** held by **ALLPCB** inspired me to pursue my idea, implement it, and participate in the competition.

The PCB consists of 11 LEDs in total:

> * 4 LANDING/TAKEOFF lights (2 on each side to depict high intensity)
> * 3 NAVIGATION lights (1 Left, 1 Right, 1 Tail)
> * 2 STROBE lights (1 Left, 1 Right)
> * 1 BEACON light (TOP)
> * 1 TAXI light (NOSE)

I added slide switches to turn the TAXI light and the LANDING/TAKEOFF lights ON or OFF. For the flashing lights, I have used timer IC555 and Decade counter IC4017. The circuit can be powered by a 9V battery.

I designed the PCB using EasyEDA. After verifying the circuit by doing a quick prototype testing, I ordered the PCBs from ALLPCB. ALLPCB is a very well known PCB manufacturer who provides quality PCBs at low cost.
