# Aircraft_Lights_PCB

Project Background
>Aviation and technology have always fascinated me, ever since I was a child. I've always been fascinated by aircraft and airspace, as well as how organised and systematic the entire aviation industry is. Each step protects the plane's and passengers' safety. One of the various safety measures used in aviation is the use of exterior lighting on an aircraft.

# Exterior lights on an Aircraft.
There are various lights on the exterior of an aircrafts, each having its unique task. Some of the important lights are as follows:
> * **LANDING/TAKEOFF LIGHTS**- These lights are used while the aircraft is taking off or while landing. They are very high intensity lights which help the pilot of an aircraft have a better visibility of the runway or any obstacles.
> * **TAXI LIGHTS**- These lights help pilots have a better visibility at the taxiways of an airport while moving towards the apron after landing or moving towards the runway for takeoff.
> * **RUNWAY TURNOFF LIGHTS**- These lights help pilot identify the runway exit points after landing. The lights are pointing towards side of the runway which makes it easier to spot an exit.
> * **NAVIGATION LIGHTS**- These lights are helpful for other near by planes to identify the direction where the plane is moving. When mid air during high speeds, it is important to know the direction of an aircraft to near by planes. One can identify the direction based on colour which defines the positioning as follows:
>   * **LEFT NAV LIGHT**- These lights are placed on the tip of the left wing. They generally are RED coloured.
>   * **RIGHT NAV LIGHT**- These lights are placed on the tip of the right wing. They generally are GREEN coloured.
>   * **TAIL NAV LIGHT**- These lights are placed near the tail of the aircraft. They generally are WHITE coloured.
> * **STROBE LIGHTS**-
>   * **LEFT STROBE LIGHT**-
>   * **RIGHT STROBE LIGHT**-
>   * **TAIL STROBE LIGHT**-
> * **BEACON LIGHT**- This light is helpful for any observer on the ground to identify that the aircraft has its engine up and rolling. It makes the observer causious to not get close to the aircraft. It is a RED coloured flashing light, generally located on the bottom or the top of the aircraft's fuselage.

# About the Aircraft_Lights_PCB

The Aviation and Electronics fanatic in me had an idea to design a PCB that depicted the exteriorÂ lights of an aircraft. I decided to make an Aircraft shaped PCB to demonstrate the generalised placement of lights on an aircraft. The PCB consists of 11 LEDs.
